# mnist_cnn
MNIST CNN Classification
This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset from a CSV file, create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras, and train/test the model.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
You can install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy matplotlib
Usage
Clone this repository or download the script.

Download the MNIST dataset in CSV format from here and place it in the train_data directory.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python mnist_cnn.py
Follow the menu options to train the CNN, test it, and evaluate its accuracy.
Description
The script loads the MNIST dataset from a CSV file and preprocesses the data.

It defines a simple CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.

You can train the model by specifying the number of training epochs.

Test the model with randomly selected samples from the validation set.

Evaluate the accuracy of the model on the validation set.

The menu-driven interface makes it easy to interact with the script.
