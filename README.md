# mnist_cnn
MNIST CNN Classification
This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset from a CSV file, create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras, and train/test the model.


It defines a simple CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.

You can train the model by specifying the number of training epochs.

Test the model with randomly selected samples from the validation set.

Evaluate the accuracy of the model on the validation set.

The menu-driven interface makes it easy to interact with the script.
